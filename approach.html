      At ActivateEd, every lesson is built on a specially designed curriculum that balances flexibility and structure. We map out clear skill progressions. We meet students where they are. We move them forward rapidly without cutting corners.

      <h3>Multisensory in nature</h3>
      <p>
        Students learn most effectively when more than one sense is being used. Our instruction is visual and tactile from the beginning, with auditory reinforcement added. Manipulatives, write and wipe boards, magnetic tiles, and traceable letter paths make abstract concepts concrete. This research based, multisensory methodology consistently strengthens learning and retention.

      <h3>Color coding that describes</h3>
      <p>
        We apply uniform color systems in order to minimize cognitive load and make patterns stand out. Sounds, types of syllables, parts of speech, steps in a strategy, and problem structures all receive their own color family. Students are able to "see" structure at a glance and later recall it with less effort.

      <h3>Fast reading improvement using decoding/encoding</h3>
      <p>
        Our unique method instructs reading and spelling together. Not only do students decode words, but they encode them as well. This accelerates transfer from discrete practice to reading and writing.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card pop">
      <h3>Resolving the end of word issue</h3>
      <p>
        Most early readers lose energy before the end sounds. We tackle this head on. Short, high repetition drills sharpen phonemic awareness and have students hold all sounds through the last letter. We do exact blending and segmenting practice, then develop memory for word end clusters so texts are read to the end.

      <h3>"Rule breakers" learned at the right time</h3>
      <p>
        Irregular words ("was," "said," "one") follow later when foundations are automatic. We first gain mastery of totally decodable words ("bat," "ship," "jump"). Then, and only then, do we introduce rule breakers with clear visual marking and memory cues, avoiding confusion and guess reading.
      </p>

    <article class="card pop">
      <h3>Knowledge from day one</h3>
      <p>
        We teach upper level comprehension skills side by side with decoding. Students learn to monitor purpose, predict structure, and track meaning while reading. We use purposeful highlighting to move beyond underlining "introduction, main idea, conclusion." Color cues differentiate claims, evidence, tone shifts, and cause/effect chains so thinking is visible on the page.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card pop">
      <h3>Mind maps that organize ideas</h3>
      <p>
        Idea maps, sequence charts, compare/contrast matrices, and cause-effect chains help students plan writing and discuss texts with precision. Over time, these maps become internal checklists that students can run through in their heads, even without paper.

      <h3>Math that lasts</h3>
      <p>
        Math is not abstract here. We begin with manipulative representations, then transition. For example: money is a common anchor since it's real world and intuitive, so we use it. We still drill, since fluency is important, but we ensure "old school" drilling is enjoyable through games and immediate feedback.

    <article class="card pop">
      <h3>Motivation that builds habits: the Ticket System</h3>
      <p>
        Students earn tickets throughout the lesson for accuracy, resilience, and focus. Tickets can be exchanged for prizes right away or saved for bigger rewards later. This simple economy teaches goal setting, delayed gratification, and consistent effort. These skills transfer beyond academics.

      <h3>A group of qualified educators</h3>
      <p>
        Our tutors are all qualified teachers trained in our curriculum and approach. We have common lesson frameworks, progressions, and materials. Our quality is always high.
