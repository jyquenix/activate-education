          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Multisensory in nature</h3>
            <p>
              Students learn most effectively when more than one sense is engaged. Our instruction is visual and tactile from the beginning, with auditory reinforcement layered in. Manipulatives, write-and-wipe boards, magnetic tiles, and traceable letter paths make abstract concepts concrete. This research-based, multisensory methodology strengthens learning and retention.

          <!-- Color coding -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Color coding that describes</h3>
            <p>
              We apply uniform color systems to reduce cognitive load and make patterns stand out. Sounds, syllable types, parts of speech, steps in a strategy, and problem structures each get their own color family. Students can ‚Äúsee‚Äù structure at a glance and recall it later with less effort.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Decoding/Encoding -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Fast reading improvement using decoding/encoding</h3>
            <p>
              Our method teaches reading and spelling together. Students don‚Äôt just decode words; they also encode them. This accelerates transfer from discrete practice to fluent reading and authentic writing.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- End-of-word -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Resolving the end-of-word issue</h3>
            <p>
              Many early readers lose energy before the final sounds. We tackle this head-on. Short, high-repetition drills sharpen phonemic awareness and train students to hold all sounds through the last letter. We practice accurate blending/segmenting, then build memory for ending clusters so words are read‚Äîand understood‚Äîto the end.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Rule breakers -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>‚ÄúRule breakers‚Äù learned at the right time</h3>
            <p>
              Irregular words (‚Äúwas,‚Äù ‚Äúsaid,‚Äù ‚Äúone‚Äù) come later‚Äîafter foundations are automatic. We first secure mastery with fully decodable words (‚Äúbat,‚Äù ‚Äúship,‚Äù ‚Äújump‚Äù). Only then do we introduce rule breakers with clear visual marking and memory cues, avoiding confusion and guess-reading.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Comprehension / Knowledge -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Knowledge from day one</h3>
            <p>
              We teach upper-level comprehension alongside decoding. Students learn to track purpose, anticipate structure, and monitor meaning while reading. Purposeful highlighting moves beyond ‚Äúintroduction, main idea, conclusion‚Äù to flag claims, evidence, tone shifts, and cause/effect chains so thinking is visible on the page.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Thinking maps -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Mind maps that organize ideas</h3>
            <p>
              Idea maps, sequence charts, compare/contrast matrices, and cause-effect chains help students plan writing and discuss texts with precision. Over time, these frames become internal checklists students can run mentally‚Äîeven without paper.

          <!-- Math -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Math that lasts</h3>
            <p>
              Math is not abstract here. We begin with concrete tools, bridge to pictures, then to symbols. Money is a frequent anchor because it‚Äôs intuitive and real-world. We still drill‚Äîfluency matters‚Äîbut we make ‚Äúold school‚Äù drilling enjoyable with games, timed self-challenges, and immediate feedback.

          <!-- Tickets -->
          <article class="card pop reveal">
            <h3>Motivation that builds habits: the Ticket System</h3>
            <p>
              Students earn tickets throughout the lesson for accuracy, resilience, and focus. Tickets can be exchanged for prizes right away or saved for larger rewards later. This simple economy teaches goal setting, delayed gratification, and consistent effort‚Äîskills that transfer beyond academics.
