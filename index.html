              ‚ÄúActivate Education has been a game-changer for our family. The tutors are patient and truly engage with each child at their level. Communication is clear and regular, so I always know how my daughter is progressing. Her confidence and grades have steadily improved since she started.

              ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so grateful to have found Liz and her team. My kid was more than a full year behind grade level in reading at the end of first grade, and super resistant to practice because it was so hard for him and he felt like a failure. A year on, he is virtually at grade level (ie, made two years‚Äô progress in one). The sessions are fun and playful, with short intense blocks of work tailored to his specific needs, and broken up with rest and rewards (great for ADHD kids!). I‚Äôm so relieved and grateful for the expertise and support he has had. Highly recommended!!‚Äù
