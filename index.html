              ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so grateful to have found Liz and her team. My kid was more than a full year behind grade level in reading at the end of first grade, and super resistant to practice because it was so hard for him and he felt like a failure. A year on, he is virtually at grade level (ie, made two years‚Äô progress in one). The sessions are fun and playful, with short intense blocks of work tailored to his specific needs, and broken up with rest and rewards (great for ADHD kids!). I‚Äôm so relieved and grateful for the expertise and support he has had. Highly recommended!!‚Äù
